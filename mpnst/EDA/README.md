# EDA

This directory contains two exploratory data analyses I performed previously:

1. **eda.ipynb**: This file shows exploratory data analysis on the coderdata structure.
2. **coderdata_rna_protein_eda.ipynb**: This file shows several PCA plots performed on RNA and proteomics data to understand the data structure and batch effects from each omics type.

Several scripts listed here are created to understand the distribution of each omics type or to preprocess the data.
